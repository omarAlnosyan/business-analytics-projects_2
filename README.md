This repository contains the final projects I completed as part of **Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree**.  
Throughout this program, I developed essential data skills including working with spreadsheets (Excel), querying databases using **SQL**, and building interactive dashboards using **Tableau**.

Each project applies real-world datasets and focuses on extracting business insights through clear analysis and data-driven storytelling.

## 📍 Part 1: Data Visualization Interpretation
In this project, I analyzed a Tableau dashboard showing malaria deaths in Africa.  
I highlighted key insights, including the decline of deaths in DRC, Comoros, and across the continent.  
The project strengthened my ability to interpret visuals and summarize findings clearly in writing.

## 📍 Part 2: Revenue Distribution Analysis
Using spreadsheet tools and visual statistics, I analyzed company revenues across IT and Healthcare sectors.  
I compared mean vs median values, examined skewness, and explored variability in revenue patterns.  
This project sharpened my Excel modeling and interpretation of histograms and distributions.

## 📍 Part 4: US Census Demographics Dashboard
Using 2015 US Census data, I built multiple Tableau dashboards to explore:
- Public transit access across states
- Relationship between income and poverty
- Ethnic origin distribution
- Income distribution by county

These dashboards were combined into a final interactive report to uncover regional patterns and economic inequalities.
